I started this project on 2/10/2013 and completed it on 2/16/2013. The total time spent was about 10 hours.

I did not consult with any other students during the course of this assignment.
I did not use any outside resources in completing this assignment other than the course webpage.

I know of only two bugs in the code. First, it throws an error if you open the load url dialog and then hit "cancel" (this throws some errors but doesn't stop the program).
Second, there is sometimes a heap overflow when working with the King James Bible text. 

This assignment was more challenging than the first two but also more interesting. Some of the starter code was less than transparent. 
For example, I was initially building WordNgrams the way I'd use .substring: new WordNgram(list, i, i+k) rather than WordNgram(list, i, k). 
The use of JUnit was also an interesting and helpful feature of this assignment--I hope we learn more about it.
