I started this project on 3/1/2013 and completed it on 3/3/2013. The total time spent was about 10 hours.

I did not consult with any other students during the course of this assignment.
I did not use any outside resources in completing this assignment other than the course webpage.

I know of no bugs in my code. 

This assignment was the most challenging yet, but the instructions were also the most clear. I liked that the applications of in-class concepts were pretty direct. 
The only thing that wasn't entirely clear was what information was supposed to be included in analysis.pdf, so hopefully I did that part correctly. 
I also liked the JUnit tests in the assignment and hope we learn more about them in class.
