I started this project on 4/8/2013 and completed it on 4/16/2013. The total time spent was about 18 hours.

I did not consult with any other students or TAs/UTAs during the course of this assignment.
Although we were allowed to work with other students, I worked alone on this assignment. 
I did not use any outside resources in completing this assignment other than the course webpage.

This assignment was the most challenging so far. In part that made it interesting--working at the bit level to compress files was neat.
However, part of the challenge was unnecessary because the instructions were so unclear. There were (at least) three different pages on the course website that had to be checked to make sure I was doing the assignment correctly, and sometimes these contained contradictory or out-of-date information. 
These were the least helpful assignment instructions of the semester.
