I started this project on 3/26/2013 and completed it on 4/2/2013. The total time spent was about 10 hours.

I did not consult with any other students during the course of this assignment.
I did not use any outside resources in completing this assignment other than the course webpage.

I know of no bugs in my code. 

This assignment was both interesting and fun. I thought the instructions were mostly clear except for which set of scenarios we were suppose to compare the running times for.
This project also made the most use of the data structures we have learned in class, which I liked.
I also liked that JUnit tests were provided so we could check our code as we went.
