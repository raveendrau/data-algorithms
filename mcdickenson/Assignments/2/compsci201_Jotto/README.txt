I started this project on 1/30/2013 and completed it on 2/2/2013. The total time spent was about 10 hours.

I did not consult with any other students during the course of this assignment.
I did not use any outside resources in completing this assignment other than the course webpage.

I do not know of any bugs in the code, other than that the guess can sometimes be repeated multiple times if the list of potential words is short.

This was a good assignment overall. It was a bit tough to get started and understand how the model/view work together and how the initialize() method works. 
Once I understood those things, however, the remainder of the assignment was straightforward. The TODO statements in the code were very helpful, although the length of some of the comments made it hard to scroll through the code.
