I started this project on 3/20/2013 and completed it on 3/22/2013. The total time spent was about 7 hours.

I did not consult with any other students during the course of this assignment.
I did not use any outside resources in completing this assignment other than the course webpage.

I know of no bugs in my code. 

This was an interesting assignment. I felt that the instructions were better written than for the previous assignments.
Each step was very clear and broken up into manageable chunks. It was also somewhat fun to play the game while testing.
