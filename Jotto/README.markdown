Jotto, the word game, that I had done in CompSci 101 in Python was not any easier to do this time round with Java. I felt the docs on Jotto were a lot more detailed than the previous time I tackled it.

## About Jotto

Took about 3 days and and off, I know I need to get better at understanding the instructions and guidelines but it takes me a while to absorb. Having the process model diagram was a big help. 

## What it is

A set of three Java files: Jotto, JottoModel and JottoViewer. 

## Additional Features

Would have liked to tackle the extra credit, but my priority is really to get up to speed with other assigments that I am behind in.
