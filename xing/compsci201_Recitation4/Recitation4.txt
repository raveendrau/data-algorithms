Part 2: The reason ListRemove does not work is because the method removeFromList() 
		loops through each word and removes every word that starts with "a" without
		resetting the index i. This means that every time an "a" word is encountered,
		the ArrayList list shortens by 1, index i, which referred to the index of the 
		original "a" word, points to the word after it instead. Thus, in the next 
		iteration of the loop, the next word (two words after the original "a" word)
		will come up, in turn effectively skipping a word. Since the two "a" words are 
		one after another in fruit2.txt, the seond one is skipped.
